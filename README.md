# WEATHER-DATA-ANALYSIS
DS PROJECT
The Weather Data Analysis Project aims to explore and extract insights from historical weather data to understand patterns, trends, and correlations in weather conditions over time. The project involves the collection of various weather variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation across different geographical locations. Through data cleaning, processing, and visualization, the project seeks to identify seasonal trends, predict weather conditions, and assess the impact of specific factors like location and time on weather patterns. Machine learning models may also be employed to make weather predictions based on historical trends. Ultimately, the project helps in making informed decisions for sectors like agriculture, transportation, and urban planning.
